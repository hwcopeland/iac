# Infrastucture as Code (IaC)


## Overview

This repo contains all needed to deploy my homelab setup.


## Sources

The main inspiration for this comes from https://github.com/chkpwd/iac. Brian has helped me a great deal in understanding the concepts provided in this repo. So to him a great deal of credit is owed. I have used his repo as a reference for moving my homelabe to k8s.
